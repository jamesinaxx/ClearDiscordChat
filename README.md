## NOTE: This bot is somewhat broken as you can no longer bulkdelete message older than 14 days! A fix may come soon but it's unlikely!
## ALSO NOTE: This bot is archived but not deprecated and still works to some extent as mentioned above.
# ClearDiscordChat
A relatively simple discord bot that clears the chat in given channel

## First of a few notes: Discord bots are rate limited to prevent crashes and what not. Depending on how many messages are being cleared it can take a while.
# Setup

10. Now click copy under token, this will copy the bot's token to your clipboard **NOTE: DO NOT SHARE THIS WITH ANYONE! THIS GIVES ANYBODY WITH IT FULL ACCESS TO YOUR BOT AND ALL IT'S MAGICAL ABILITIES!**
11. Save this token somewhere local on your device and again, don't share it with anyone!

## The dark side
### This guide will show you how to setup the actual bots and start using them on your server

Alright so. Now you have created the bot, and you have the token! Congrats! That's the easy part...
Now we have to set up the code behind the bot so it can actually do something.

**Coming soon!**

# That's that!
You have now successfully got the bot(s) running on your server! If you would like to intergrate these commands into your current bot, imma leave that up to you to figure out for now, if you coded it yourself I would assume you would have the knowledge on how to do it!
